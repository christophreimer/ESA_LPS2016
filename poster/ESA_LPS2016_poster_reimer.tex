    \block{..:: MOTIVATION ::..}{Geophysical parameters derived from
      space-borne Earth Observation Systems are either assigned to discrete
      points on a fixed Earth grid (e.g. regular lat/lon grid) or located on
      orbital point nodes with a customized arrangement, often in-line with the
      instrument's measurement geometry. The driving factors of the choice and
      structure of the underlying grid are typically spatial resolution,
      instrument geometry, instrument measurement technique and application. In
      this context, the most practical solution for the choice of the sampling
      distance represents supporting the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. In
      other words, the spatial sampling rate should be half of the spatial
      resolution establishing a sufficient condition to capture all the

      In this study we propose a new global fixed Earth grid, the so-called
      Equi1 grid, and demonstrate its structure, usability and field of

      the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, by applying a nearly-constant
      spatial sampling rate. The general appearance is similar to a Reduced
      Gaussian Grid, which represents a gridded coordinate system often used for
      scientific modeling on the Earth surface. The properties of the Equi1 grid
      are compared to common Earth observation grid systems (e.g. EASE-grid,
      Gaussian Grid) discussing the advantages and disadvantages. Finally, a
      real-world example will be presented based on surface soil moisture
      information derived from Metop ASCAT.}
